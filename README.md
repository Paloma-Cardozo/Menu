# ReDI School of Digital Integration - Interactive Menu solution

This is my solution to the **ReDI School of Digital Integration** challenge focused on building a restaurant menu layout, using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and accessible design.
The goal of this challenge was to build a clean and responsive restaurant menu. I focused on using **HTML5 semantic elements**, **CSS Flexbox** and **mobile-first design** principles. 
The project helped me reinforce structure, alignment, and spacing using modern layout systems. I made sure the text was legible, the content visually organized, and the experience user-friendly across different screen sizes.
